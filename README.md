## About
  WIP - An app built with React Native where you can send GOT Shame to your friends.
My primary motivation for this app is to teach my younger brother how to use React Native.
## Improvements I'd like to do
- [ ] Implement the whole thing

## Prerequisites for running the app
  1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  3. (Optional) [Expo app](https://expo.io) to view the app on your phone
  4. (Optional) [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12#) for running the app on an iOS simulator on a Mac
 5. Yarn

## Running the app
  1. Clone the project to your computer
  2. Open Terminal/Command prompt
  3. Navigate to the project directory
  4. Run `$ yarn install`
  5. You now have two options of viewing/running the app:
     1. **Expo**: Run `$ yarn start` and follow the instructions that appear in the Terminal/Command prompt
     2. **iOS simulator**: Run `$ yarn run ios`
  6. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ (If not: [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md#troubleshooting))
